# Color Theory Research for LitSpark Brand Solutions

## Overview

This document presents comprehensive research on color theory principles as they apply to LitSpark Brand Solutions' brand identity development. The research focuses on understanding how our primary gold (#F2BF0F) and gray color scheme can effectively communicate our brand values while ensuring accessibility for all users.

## Color Theory Fundamentals

### Basic Principles of Color Theory

Color theory is the conceptual framework that explains how humans perceive color and the visual effects of color combinations. It encompasses several key principles:

1. **Color Wheel**: A circular organization of colors that shows relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.

2. **Color Harmony**: The pleasing arrangement of colors based on their positions on the color wheel:
   - Complementary (colors opposite each other)
   - Analogous (colors adjacent to each other)
   - Triadic (three colors equally spaced)
   - Tetradic (four colors arranged in two complementary pairs)

3. **Color Context**: How colors appear in relation to surrounding colors.

4. **Color Temperature**: The perception of colors as warm (reds, oranges, yellows) or cool (blues, greens, purples).

5. **Color Properties**:
   - Hue: The pure color itself
   - Saturation: The intensity or purity of a color
   - Value: The lightness or darkness of a color
