## Overview

The LitSpark Brand Solutions platform is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users, including those with disabilities. This document outlines how our utility services comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Notification Service

### Accessibility Features

1. **Semantic Structure**
   - Notifications use proper semantic HTML elements
   - ARIA roles are applied where needed
   - Proper heading hierarchy is maintained

2. **Color and Contrast**
   - Notification types use the brand's gold (#F2BF0F) and gray color scheme
   - All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Information is not conveyed by color alone

3. **Keyboard Accessibility**
   - All notification interactions are keyboard accessible
   - Focus states are clearly visible
   - Logical tab order is maintained

4. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Notifications include appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers
   - Notification types have appropriate roles (alert, status)

5. **Email Notifications**
   - Email templates use semantic HTML
   - Text alternatives are provided for all images
   - Email content is readable without CSS

### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Example of accessible notification creation
const notification = {
  id: generateId(),
  userId: options.userId || null,
  type,
  title,
  message: options.message,
  channel,
  link: options.link || null,
  metadata: options.metadata || {},
  isRead: false,
  createdAt: options.createdAt || new Date(),
  updatedAt: options.createdAt || new Date(),
  // Accessibility properties
  ariaLive: type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.ERROR ? 'assertive' : 'polite',
  role: type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.ERROR ? 'alert' : 'status',
};
```

## Logger Service

### Accessibility Features

1. **Error Handling**
   - Errors are logged with appropriate context
   - User-facing error messages are clear and helpful
   - Sensitive information is not exposed in logs

2. **Request Context**
   - Request IDs are generated for tracking
   - HTTP requests are logged with appropriate context
   - Response headers include request IDs for client-side debugging

### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Example of accessible request context middleware
const addRequestContext = (req, res, next) => {
  const requestId = req.headers['x-request-id'] || generateRequestId();
  res.setHeader('x-request-id', requestId);
  req.logger = logger.child({ requestId, method: req.method, url: req.originalUrl });
  req.logger.http(`HTTP ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`);
  next();
};
```

## Monitoring Service

### Accessibility Features

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - System performance is monitored to ensure responsiveness
   - Warnings are logged when performance thresholds are exceeded
   - Health checks provide status information

2. **Request Monitoring**
   - Request times are tracked to identify slow responses
   - Error rates are monitored to detect issues
   - Endpoint usage is tracked to identify popular features

### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Example of accessible health check endpoint
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  const health = monitoringService.getHealthStatus();
  
  // Set appropriate status code
  const statusCode = health.status === 'UP' ? 200 : 503;
  
  // Include accessibility headers
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store');
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  
  res.status(statusCode).json(health);
});
```

## Compliance Checklist

The following checklist verifies compliance with key WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:

### Perceivable

- ✅ **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All non-text content has text alternatives
- ✅ **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Information, structure, and relationships can be programmatically determined
- ✅ **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence**: Content is presented in a meaningful sequence
- ✅ **1.4.1 Use of Color**: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information
- ✅ **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)**: Text has sufficient contrast against its background (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- ✅ **1.4.4 Resize Text**: Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- ✅ **1.4.5 Images of Text**: Images of text are only used for decoration or where a specific presentation is essential

### Operable

- ✅ **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality is available from a keyboard
- ✅ **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: Keyboard focus is not trapped
- ✅ **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Skip links are provided to bypass blocks of repeated content
- ✅ **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Focus order preserves meaning and operability
- ✅ **2.4.6 Headings and Labels**: Headings and labels describe topic or purpose
- ✅ **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: Keyboard focus indicator is visible

### Understandable

- ✅ **3.1.1 Language of Page**: The default human language of the page can be programmatically determined
- ✅ **3.2.1 On Focus**: Elements do not change context when they receive focus
- ✅ **3.2.2 On Input**: Changing the setting of any UI component does not automatically cause a change of context
- ✅ **3.3.1 Error Identification**: Input errors are clearly identified
- ✅ **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions**: Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input
- ✅ **3.3.3 Error Suggestion**: Suggestions for correction are provided when input errors are detected
- ✅ **3.3.4 Error Prevention**: For pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions, submissions are reversible, checked, and confirmed

### Robust

- ✅ **4.1.1 Parsing**: HTML is well-formed
- ✅ **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: For all UI components, the name, role, and value can be programmatically determined
