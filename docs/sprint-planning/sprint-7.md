## Accessibility Implementation

### Deployment Accessibility Checklist

```markdown
# Accessibility Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Run axe-core accessibility tests
- [ ] Verify no critical or high-priority issues
- [ ] Address all WCAG 2.1 AA violations

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode
- [ ] Test with text zoom (up to 200%)
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preferences

### Content Checks
- [ ] Verify all images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Check heading structure and hierarchy
- [ ] Verify form labels and error messages
- [ ] Check color contrast with the gold (#F2BF0F) and gray color scheme
- [ ] Verify ARIA attributes are used correctly

## Deployment Process

### Build Verification
- [ ] Verify minification preserves accessibility attributes
- [ ] Check that CSS optimizations maintain focus indicators
- [ ] Ensure JavaScript bundling preserves event handlers

### Server Configuration
- [ ] Configure appropriate caching headers
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers for assistive technology
- [ ] Configure CSP to allow necessary assistive technology scripts

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure accessibility error logging
- [ ] Set up alerts for accessibility regressions
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanism for accessibility issues

## Post-Deployment Checks

### Live Site Verification
- [ ] Run automated tests against production environment
- [ ] Perform manual keyboard navigation test
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility in production
- [ ] Verify forms and interactive elements work with assistive technology
- [ ] Check performance impact on assistive technology

### Documentation
- [ ] Update accessibility statement with latest audit results
- [ ] Document any known issues and workarounds
- [ ] Verify contact information for accessibility feedback

## Rollback Plan

If critical accessibility issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. Assess the impact and number of users affected
2. Determine if a hotfix can be deployed quickly
3. If not, initiate rollback to previous version
4. Communicate the issue and timeline to affected users
5. Prioritize fix in the development pipeline
```

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Server configuration issues | High | Medium | Use infrastructure as code and automated provisioning |
| SSL certificate expiration | High | Low | Set up automated renewal and monitoring |
| Deployment failures | High | Medium | Implement blue-green deployment and automated rollback |
| User training gaps | Medium | Medium | Provide comprehensive documentation and recorded training sessions |

## Definition of Done

- Production environment is fully configured and secure
- CI/CD pipeline is operational with automated testing
- Comprehensive documentation is available for all user roles
- User training has been conducted and recorded
- All accessibility features are verified in production
- Monitoring and alerting systems are operational
