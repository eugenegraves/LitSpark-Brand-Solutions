# Sprint 0: Project Setup & Environment Configuration

## Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks (March 15 - March 29, 2025)

Sprint 0 focuses on establishing the foundation for the project by setting up development environments, configuring CI/CD pipelines, establishing development workflows, and creating the initial project structure and architecture.

## Goals

1. Set up development, testing, staging, and production environments
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Establish development workflows and standards
4. Create initial project structure and architecture

## Tasks

- Include accessibility-focused components in the base architecture

### Task 4: Standards & Documentation

**Description**: Document coding standards, component guidelines, and project workflows to ensure consistency across the team.

**Subtasks**:
- Document coding standards
- Create component development guidelines
- Establish accessibility requirements
- Set up project management tools

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Comprehensive coding standards documentation
- Component development guidelines with examples
- Accessibility requirements documentation based on WCAG 2.1 AA
- Project management tools and templates set up

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- Detailed documentation of accessibility requirements
- Guidelines for implementing accessible components
- Focus on the gold (#F2BF0F) and gray color scheme that meets contrast requirements

## Deliverables

1. Fully configured development environment
2. Operational CI/CD pipeline
3. Initial project structure with basic functionality
4. Documentation of standards and workflows

## Technical Implementation Details

### Development Environment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/litspark
    depends_on:
      - mongo
  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

## Accessibility Implementation

### Color Scheme

- Primary Gold (#F2BF0F) on dark backgrounds meets WCAG AA for large text
- Light text (#F8F9FA) on dark backgrounds meets WCAG AAA (16:1 contrast)
- Interactive elements use enhanced contrast ratios

### Focus Management

- All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- Focus ring uses gold color (#F2BF0F) with 2px offset
- Skip links implemented for keyboard navigation

### Testing Tools

- jest-axe for automated accessibility testing
- eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for linting accessibility issues

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |

| Environment configuration issues | High | Medium | Detailed documentation and team training |
| CI/CD pipeline complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple pipeline and iterate |
| Accessibility standards not followed | High | Low | Regular audits and automated testing |
| Team unfamiliarity with tools | Medium | Medium | Training sessions and pair programming |

## Definition of Done

- All code follows established coding standards
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- CI/CD pipeline successfully runs all tests
