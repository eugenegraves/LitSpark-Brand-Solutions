# Project Management Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the project management tools, processes, and workflows for the LitSpark Brand Solutions project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent project tracking, collaboration, and delivery.

## Project Management Tools

### 1. Issue Tracking

**Tool**: GitHub Issues

**Setup**:
- All tasks, bugs, and feature requests are tracked in GitHub Issues
- Issues are organized using labels, milestones, and projects
- Each issue should include:
  - Clear title
  - Detailed description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Priority label
  - Assigned milestone
  - Relevant labels (bug, feature, documentation, etc.)

**Labels**:
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `feature`: New feature or enhancement
- `documentation`: Documentation updates
- `accessibility`: Accessibility-related issues
- `design`: Design-related issues
- `technical-debt`: Code improvements not visible to users
- `priority-high`: High priority issues
- `priority-medium`: Medium priority issues
- `priority-low`: Low priority issues

### 2. Project Boards

**Tool**: GitHub Projects

**Setup**:
- Project board columns:
  - `Backlog`: Issues that are not yet scheduled
  - `To Do`: Issues scheduled for the current sprint
  - `In Progress`: Issues currently being worked on
  - `Review`: Issues ready for review
  - `Done`: Completed issues

**Usage**:
- Issues are moved through the board as they progress
- Each issue should be assigned to a team member
- Comments should be added to issues to track progress

### 3. Documentation

**Tool**: Markdown files in the repository

**Location**: `/docs` directory

**Structure**:
- `/docs/standards`: Coding standards and guidelines
- `/docs/project-management`: Project management documentation
- `/docs/architecture`: System architecture documentation
- `/docs/api`: API documentation

### 4. Communication

**Tools**:
- **Slack**: Daily communication
- **Zoom/Teams**: Video meetings
- **GitHub Discussions**: Technical discussions

## Sprint Process

### Sprint Planning

1. **Preparation**:
   - Product Owner prepares the backlog
   - Issues are prioritized and estimated
   - Sprint goals are defined

2. **Meeting Agenda**:
   - Review sprint goals
   - Select issues for the sprint
   - Discuss implementation approach
   - Assign initial tasks

### Daily Standup

**Format**: 15-minute daily meeting

**Agenda**:
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What will you work on today?
- Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Review

**Format**: End-of-sprint demonstration

**Agenda**:
- Demonstrate completed features
- Gather feedback
- Discuss what was not completed and why

### Sprint Retrospective

**Format**: End-of-sprint reflection

**Agenda**:
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for the next sprint

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branching Strategy

**Main Branches**:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

**Feature Branches**:
- Branch from `develop`
- Format: `feature/issue-number-short-description`
- Example: `feature/42-add-login-form`

**Bug Fix Branches**:
- Branch from `develop` or `main` (for hotfixes)
- Format: `fix/issue-number-short-description`
- Example: `fix/57-login-button-not-working`

### 2. Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to `develop`
2. Fill out the pull request template
3. Request reviews from team members
4. Address review comments
5. Merge once approved and CI passes

**Pull Request Template**:
```markdown
## Description
[Description of the changes]

## Issue
Closes #[issue-number]

## Type of change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Code refactoring

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix/feature works
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] I have checked for accessibility issues
```

### 3. Code Review Guidelines

**What to Look For**:
- Code correctness
- Adherence to coding standards
- Test coverage
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Accessibility compliance

**Review Process**:
- Be constructive and respectful
- Explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Focus on the code, not the author
- Approve only when all concerns are addressed

### 4. Release Process

1. Merge `develop` into `main`
2. Create a release tag
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for issues
5. Document release notes

## Definition of Done

An issue is considered "Done" when:

1. Code is written according to standards
2. Tests are written and passing
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code is reviewed and approved
5. Accessibility requirements are met
6. The feature is deployed to staging
7. Acceptance criteria are met
8. Product Owner approves
