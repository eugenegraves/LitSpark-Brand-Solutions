# Accessibility Requirements

## Overview

LitSpark Brand Solutions is committed to creating an accessible web application that follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This document outlines the accessibility requirements and implementation guidelines for the project.

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

All components and pages must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards at minimum. Key principles include:

1. **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
2. **Operable** - User interface components and navigation must be operable
3. **Understandable** - Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable
4. **Robust** - Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

## Color and Contrast Requirements

### Brand Colors

- Primary Gold (#F2BF0F) on dark backgrounds meets WCAG AA for large text
- Light text (#F8F9FA) on dark backgrounds meets WCAG AAA (16:1 contrast)
- Interactive elements use enhanced contrast ratios

### Implementation Guidelines

- Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background (Level AA)
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background
- UI components and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors
- Do not rely on color alone to convey information

## Keyboard Accessibility

### Requirements

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Keyboard focus must be visible and clearly indicated
- Focus order must be logical and intuitive
- No keyboard traps
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use native HTML elements whenever possible
- When using custom components, ensure they can be operated with keyboard
- Implement visible focus indicators with a gold color (#F2BF0F) and 2px offset
- Test keyboard navigation thoroughly

## Focus Management

### Requirements

- All interactive elements must have visible focus indicators
- Focus must be managed appropriately in interactive components
- Focus should not be lost or trapped

### Implementation Guidelines

- Focus ring uses gold color (#F2BF0F) with 2px offset
- Skip links implemented for keyboard navigation
- Focus should be moved programmatically when needed (e.g., when opening a modal)
- Test focus management with keyboard navigation

## Semantic HTML

### Requirements

- Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
- Maintain a logical document structure
- Use proper heading hierarchy

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) for groups of related items
- Use tables (`<table>`) only for tabular data, with appropriate headers

## ARIA Implementation

### Requirements

- Use ARIA attributes only when necessary
- Follow ARIA authoring practices
- Test ARIA implementation with screen readers

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use ARIA roles, states, and properties correctly
- Provide ARIA labels for elements without visible text
- Update ARIA attributes dynamically as needed
- Test with screen readers to ensure proper implementation

## Form Controls

### Requirements

- All form controls must have associated labels
- Form validation errors must be clearly identified
- Form controls must be operable with keyboard

### Implementation Guidelines

- High contrast form inputs
- Clear focus and error states
- Labels properly associated with inputs
- Provide clear error messages and instructions

## Text Alternatives

### Requirements

- All non-text content must have text alternatives
- Text alternatives must convey the same information as the non-text content

### Implementation Guidelines

- Alt text for images
- ARIA labels for icons
- Text alternatives for non-text content
- Captions for videos
- Transcripts for audio content

## Color Independence

### Requirements

- Information must not be conveyed by color alone
- UI elements must be distinguishable without relying on color

### Implementation Guidelines

- Information not conveyed by color alone
- Icons and text used alongside color indicators
- Patterns/borders used to differentiate elements when needed

## Responsive Design and Zoom

### Requirements

- Content must be responsive and adaptable to different viewport sizes
- Content must be zoomable to at least 200% without loss of functionality

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use relative units (rem, em) for font sizes and spacing
- Test at different zoom levels (up to 200%)
- Ensure text containers expand with larger text
- Maintain functionality at all zoom levels

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Testing

- Use automated accessibility testing tools (jest-axe, Lighthouse, etc.)
- Include accessibility tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Address all critical and serious issues

### Manual Testing

- Test with keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
- Test with high contrast mode
- Test with different zoom levels
